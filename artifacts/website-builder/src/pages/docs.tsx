          The CertXA Website Builder lets you create a professional salon website in minutes — no
          coding required. Your live site is hosted at <strong>yourname.mysalon.me</strong> and can
          optionally use your own custom domain.
        </p>
        <Step n={1} title="Open the builder">
          Log in to your SalonOS dashboard and click <strong>Website Builder</strong> (or navigate

        <Step n={2} title="Pick a template">
          Go to <strong>Templates</strong> in the top navigation. Browse the gallery, filter by
          salon type (Nail Salon, Barbershop, Hair Salon), and click a card to preview it
          full-screen. When you find one you like, click <strong>Use Template</strong>.
        </Step>

          Give your website a name (e.g. "Lumière Nail Studio") and pick your subdomain slug —
          this becomes <strong>yourslug.mysalon.me</strong>. Slugs must be lowercase, 2–63
          characters, letters and numbers only.

          The editor opens automatically. Edit text, swap images, rearrange sections, then click{" "}

          Templates are professionally designed, fully responsive salon websites. Each template is
          built for a specific salon type but can be used for any business.

        <p className="font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-4">Filtering</p>

          need to reload the page.

          You can switch to a different template at any time by creating a new website from it.
